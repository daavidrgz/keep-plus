**Important note**: As there is no "Register" functionality implemented, it's recommended to use the "Log In with Google" button.
Much more secure as it's transparent to the developer, abstracting all the password-encryption mess.

Keep Plus is a web application that allows you to create and manage
simple notes with a **polished interface** and **integration with google auth**.

It uses:
* A [Mongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) database to store scores and users
* A backend in Node using [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and [Passport.js](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) to handle google OAuth
* A frontend in pure [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) in a single page
